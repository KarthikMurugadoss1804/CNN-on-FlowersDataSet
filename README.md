# CNN on FlowersDataSet
 Improving the image classification using CNN, Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning and Ensemble Techniques

## Problem Specification 

The objective of this assessment is to build a range of deep learning models using convolutional neural networks. The data we will be using a modified version of the Flowers 17 dataset. You can find the original dataset here. This is a multi-class classification problem with 17 possible classes (17 different classes of flowers). The images have significant variation in pose and lighting and there is also significant intra-class variation as well as close similarity between other distinct classes. 
**What makes this dataset even more challenging is that there are only 80 images for each class**. Therefore, in total there are just 1360 images.

## Part A

Explores the application of convolutional networks, data augmentation and ensemble techniques.

## Part B

Focuses on transfer learning (specifically the use of CNNs as feature extractors and the application of fine tuning with pre-trained CNNs).
